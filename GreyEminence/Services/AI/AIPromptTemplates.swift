        purpose. Do not summarize the user's project-overview preamble as if it were the \
        outcome of the call.
        - "summary" MUST be a JSON array of section objects as shown above. Return [] if there \
        is not enough substantive content yet — never return filler sections.
        - Group related points into coherent sections. Aim for 2-5 sections with 2-6 points each. \
        Each section covers one theme or topic area from the meeting.
        - Each point's "label" is the subject (1-4 words, title case). "detail" is 1-3 sentences \
        of specific, concrete information — what was discussed, decided, or proposed.
        - Never include meta-observations about the meeting itself (e.g. "Meeting covered several topics").
        - The "intro" field is optional — include it only when a sentence of context genuinely helps \
        frame the points below it. Otherwise omit the key entirely.
        - "action_items" are every concrete commitment spoken in this meeting, whoever owns \
        it. The app stores all of them and filters the on-screen list for the tool user; \
        dossiers export per person. Include (1) tasks the user committed to or was asked to \
        take on, (2) tasks another attendee clearly owns, and (3) tasks nobody clearly owns. \
        Be selective: only concrete, deliberate commitments — never vague intentions, \
        hypotheticals, or process observations. A typical 30-minute meeting yields 3-8 \
        genuine action items; more than 12 means you are over-extracting — merge related \
        tasks and drop the marginal ones. \
        Set "assignee" to "Me" when the task is the tool user's, the other participant's \
        name when they own it, or null when ownership is genuinely unclear. \
        Set "source_quote" to a short verbatim snippet (one sentence, 5-25 words) copied from \
        the transcript that triggered this action — the exact words a speaker said, not your \
        paraphrase. This anchors the task to a specific moment in the conversation. Pick the \
        single most direct sentence; do not concatenate multiple turns.
        - "follow_ups" are, in this order: (1) questions ASKED in this meeting that were \
        not answered, (2) next questions implied by work still outstanding in THIS conversation \
        (a document to fix, a number another speaker voiced that the user's materials must match, \
        a decision that lacks an owner), (3) only then a few true blind spots. \
        Do NOT emit a generic domain questionnaire (financing status, environmental diligence, \
        engagement, timeline) unless someone in THIS meeting raised that gap. If the meeting \
        was about correcting outbound documents or aligning them with what a speaker actually \
        said, follow-ups must be about those documents and those facts. \
        DO NOT restate a summary point or an action item as a question. Quality over quantity: \
        2-5 sharp questions beat a long list. If nothing qualifies, return an empty array.
        - "topics" should include TWO types, merged into one flat array ordered by prominence: \
        (1) Theme topics: broad subjects discussed (e.g. "System Design", "Code Review Process") \
        (2) Key terms: specific proper nouns, acronyms, tools, services, platforms, libraries, \
        or named systems mentioned (e.g. "Jira", "Confluence", "Kafka", "DynamoDB", "React"). \
        Extract ALL specific named entities — these are critical for cross-meeting knowledge mapping. \
        Prefer the canonical form (e.g. "DynamoDB" not "dynamo", "Jira" not "jira").
        - If there is not enough content to produce meaningful insights, return empty arrays and \
        [] for summary. Do not generate placeholder or filler text.
        - Title: always return a 5-8 word title that names the PURPOSE (what the user was \
        trying to get done), not merely the calendar subject or a shared document's topic. \
        Omit "title" only during a rolling live pass whose user message contains PREVIOUS SUMMARY.
        - When the user message contains a PREVIOUS SUMMARY block, this is a rolling live \
        update: preserve previous action items, topics, and follow-up questions. Parse the \
        previous summary JSON, keep existing sections and points, and add new ones. Never \
        drop earlier insights unless explicitly resolved, contradicted, or revealed to be \
        owned by another attendee (per the action_items ownership rules).
        - When the user message is a fresh reanalysis or the first complete-transcript pass \
        (no PREVIOUS SUMMARY block), do not preserve any prior insights. Rewrite from this \
        transcript. Infer purpose again; a previous run may have latched onto subject matter.

        that IS the meeting. Lead the summary with that work, then the facts they need \

        - Weight the last third of the transcript more than the opening. The user \
        describing the project at the start is preamble. Decisions, prices, and \
        "can you do X" land later.

        - summary: purpose first, then decisions and the facts another speaker stated that \
        the user's materials must reflect.
        - action_items: every concrete commitment, with assignee. Include document/comms \
        work implied by the talk ("update the proposal / ROM / scope write-up so it uses \
        the numbers and wording the other speaker actually said").
        - follow_ups: unanswered questions from THIS room, then implied next questions about \
        the work product. Do not invent a due-diligence questionnaire.
        - topics: both the work product (e.g. prospect documents) and named subject-matter terms.

        subject or a shared document's topic. Example: "Align prospect docs with spoken facts" \

        outbound materials. Return it in the "title" field.

        instead of purpose — rewrite it if so. Lead with purpose, then decisions and the \

        purpose. Drop any accumulated question the transcript actually answers, that \
        overlaps an action item, or that is a generic domain questionnaire nobody raised \
        here. Unanswered in-room questions first, then outstanding work-product questions, \
        then at most a few true blind spots (including from RELATED DISCUSSIONS, when provided).
        - Consolidate topics — remove exact duplicates and merge near-duplicates, but keep both \

        acronyms, tools, services). Order themes first by prominence, then key terms alphabetically. \

        the values carry meaning. Never compress legible data into vague \
        phrases ("some metrics", "a list of items").

        genuinely aids context ("a PDF of the Q3 contract").
        - When a previous-frame description is provided, or multiple frames \
